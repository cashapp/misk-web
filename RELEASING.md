## Manual Releasing `@Misk` Packages on NPM

To update tabs to latest alpha release, follow the linked steps to use [\$ miskweb pin](https://cashapp.github.io/misk-web/docs/guides/building-a-tab/08-upgrading-misk-web-version).

This outlines the steps necessary to manually release new `@misk` packages on NPM.

## NPM Setup

- Create an NPM user at [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com/) and request membership in the [`@Misk` organization ](https://www.npmjs.com/org/misk). Membership will give you publish permissions for `@Misk` scoped packages.
- **Note:** member level may not actually be high enough to publish, needs further testing whether publish permissions are only available at Admin or Owner level.
- On your development machine, run `$ npm login` to authorize your local environment with publish permissions.
## Releasing

- `@misk` packages in this repo are managed by [Rush](https://rushjs.io/), which allows easy coordinated releases of all packages (ie. release all with a common version number). Make sure Rush is set up locally. A guide is available in the [README](README.md).
- All commands below must be run from the `misk-web` root directory.
- Use the command below to bump the version across all packages.

  ```Bash
  $ rush version --bump
  ```

- Publish to NPM with the command below. You will need to enter TOTP 2 factor authentication codes to publish each package to NPM. **If you don't have 2 factor authentication for NPM enabled, enable it immedietely.**

  ```Bash
  $ rush publish --include-all -a -p
  ```

- ðŸŽ‰ All packages will now be live on NPM!

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes included in this published version.

- Now update the example tabs `miskTab.json`, update Rush's NPM version lockfile, and confirm that everything still builds.

  ```Bash
  $ miskweb pin 0.1.3-4 -e
  $ miskweb prebuild -e
  $ rush update --full
  $ rush build
  ```

- Deploy fresh version of docs site that includes the latest `CHANGELOG.md`.

  ```Bash
  $ cd docs
  $ yarn deploy
  ```

- Commit all code changes with a commit message starting with `[RELEASE] 0.1.3-4.`

### Optional use of Rush Change for formatted changelog

- Use `rush change` to update the Changelog. Commit and squash these changes into the `[RELEASE] X.Y.Z-Q` commit.

- ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've released a new set of `@misk` packages! Downstream `misk-web` tabs can now simply update the `version` in their `miskTab.json` and on their next build, they will start using the latest packages.

## Deprecating

If a package is no longer required, you must mark it as deprecated on NPM. Use the command below with an informative message and your One Time Password for NPM 2FA.

```Bash
npm deprecate @misk/tabs@0.0.1 "Deprecation Message" --otp=
```

## Publishing `misk-web-plugin`

- `misk-web-plugin` is a Gradle plugin written in Kotlin DSL that builds Misk-Web tabs within a Java/Kotlin project.

- Builds of tabs are done within a Docker container that contains the latest version of `@misk/*` NPM packages on a Node Alpine base image.

- Publish the plugin to [Gradle M2](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.squareup.misk-web-plugin) locally by using `./gradlew pluginPublic` with `Gradle M2` credentials stored in a local `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.
