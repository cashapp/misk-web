   * Large monorepos can become intimidating for newcomers if project folder paths don't follow

   * The Rush developers recommend a "category folder" model, where buildable project folders
   * must always be exactly two levels below the repo root.  The parent folder acts as the category.
   * This provides a basic facility for grouping related projects (e.g. "apps", "libaries",

   * a unified taxonomy.  Limiting to 2 levels seems very restrictive at first, but if you have
   * 20 categories and 20 projects in each category, this scheme can easily accommodate hundreds
   * of projects.  In practice, you will find that the folder hierarchy needs to be rebalanced
   * occasionally, but if that's painful, it's a warning sign that your development style may
   * discourage refactoring.  Reorganizing the categories should be an enlightening discussion
   * that brings people together, and maybe also identifies poor coding practices (e.g. file
   * references that reach into other project's folders without using NodeJS module resolution).
